426,economic stimulus,,2020-03-18," Ministry of Finance undertook to model assumptions on the likely impact of the Coronavirus over the next four-month period to mid-July 2020. Ran three scenarios – low, medium and high impact – based on assumptions of varying degrees of losses for tourist arrivals over a four-month period.Government has adopted a package of policy measures to deal with the tremendous economic impact of COVID-19 that is already starting to be felt as hotel occupancies have fallen, as cruise ship arrivals are on a 30-day hiatus, and as hotel workers are being asked to take unpaid or vacation leave. (Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks. Individuals who are temporarily laid off because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 will be eligible for unemployment benefits, up to the regular 13-week period, if necessary",,Bahamas,"Bahamas Information Service (Government, http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/gov/government/news/dpm%20turnquest%20global%20and%20domestic%20development%20as%20a%20result%20of%20covid-19%20will%20affect%20economic%20growth%20in%20the%20short%20term%20negatively/!ut/p/b1/vZbJkptIEIafxQ8gq4piPYLEDsWOBBeCRRsggRAtlqcfPOGJmR6Pu-dgizwR_Blf8FdmVq7j9X4d39Ln5ZT2l-aW1t_eYzpBQDZ5nmRNVqJ5oAZIQpTOI9mB6916r0SUUD7M01bcPcmK2ImZq1VsPZW99OaeHTNyvOjU4yaruS7s0oTTVsfD_aIY4UiFSSHEiZrUp7YkA0m5psQp20S1rpyJOw-ZMxlpfl4Ib9RdKGF8EFAqV9a5FdvyMkjyTpPaYWXGInYejs_nJdqTlfDUTrSLigO-nUpVReiOa8eurV10P4O8YkZeZ9XEK-TGbmJbVM937CSU14Sj7UTR6pxILGHddkmn4WOPqjgplv8ih7nse7jP4xb0TT-jOmVEVHdc8twOge5a-ZfFrGgxC_zk4cF7Ly3C54AKN5DWAwqwW_p7_geCP_Nly3Q2386CJr999rG6FW0kI_hZPvk_838u-LQW4vcSmQL0IrEN3mYUwiLBd8FHFn1sEvmZgF5Hi4D5uYBZ--s9IBOvnFp1rma3nB1g-qGK_WiGczA8qnmHfRHhPoX-NoIgCwYzeABzNlE_u9gvFLsI3UDgt_b2NL19DPQM8rVA1qdfDUQvBiLwaiDxaiD1YqD26ipFv74PtXV8ya5fh_z6FXylAIQEgixFIIZmiHWo5Sdq0_CDKG7dBzybNBh7nbxgQoyyixc3qtCPqq0QWb9PbMEhlXwaecfQraK4Fsdgp0jCCFuON51Aajeu8byrMtFoN8a93bLhXvJCJ2fXOhFmza64I5s3HNHRTabd4_3Mf_myxkpzPXziivBjZYNRN-fFla04ASMYvGAOFlcIs8D4UToT8EPNqyjNC0YT-w7R9_53VzZCTbrlZ9OJfi2QFeCrgcxvB-oEWoAGMjC7gZ6MXgxkf33RvGsllkMERzGAJVlIQQDXYRnR4_ahLr2Ek_MhqGTc5JmxGdlBrjeg82vR1fNamvz8eRSn9jrKPnPIBElb0bIVkjwfF3V6QKcdCA65HbzF5iZKeSfXgn7lOkSjG7xl2B3uNgPtiIlPsg8hK4IAK6uB34_evZCeYVoeGNepN50RYetYJI2v5KMZ1JFNMuz1ch4n7D9DvTV9L4yBEsNd4B2bx-pSxngbm5rRHQ80k3fXVT_1b-O_TZb9ECwmA971oANY5j_nFQbk3M_OuOwus1faexxU0Ct2EG9VBOaAwKWgLjNrMv3YwP3-u8kCKLTq8klnyuh3A2XKYpftjPFtniKW5Yt-NZD6XcC_NljLF75ZihSFpw1kifDVwF9_hu8vORJSFAcJjiYYgoHMOhyj1ZidnPNWdJPRQbWSemxh3WY-7jv1wpFLT_KCMRuoSJTLUxXo0MCp7lJK_5SOledy13ue720rhZ0B9-bILF2s5CmcHzJ5Uo0pk72cmtpgLKhkFu1HVM9n5mgiPNEtV3V3Uz40mD8A_4r5FgykJEgp79d04rfNxprikJ14HGxPTXWbROtSzTpoRIXn01ue7yIescp0zZUrNQSTPhKgNIBA36LHjmMpX707uniqZWpDn3KyeyMk2QvahMhGzt5VBwMq4TMY2ivc2Xjyj4-dmnKYcklvH5ZvyTw7Sc0ek4ccVfdu6yw3cnt96rpu0K54xD8Gma7-jmze_yOW6_wP69wzgg!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/"
